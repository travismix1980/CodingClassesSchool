// Extra functionality includes a pause animation
// the pause animation uses code to clear out the pause animations when it is done
// by clearing the line in the console moving the cursor around and overwriting the
// line the animation is on.
// Added the ability to the reflection activity to only display a question one time
// untill all questions have been used and then it displays a line about revisiting some questions
// and resets the question list.
// Sorry assignment is late it is because of the dog bite in my hand like I mentioned.
